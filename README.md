# Auto-Generated Todo System

## ⚠️ Important Workflow Rule
**DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT `TODO.md`**. 
This file is auto-generated by a build script. Any manual changes made directly to `TODO.md` will be overwritten the next time the script runs.

## How to Add Tasks
This system aggregates tasks from two distinct sources into a single master list.

### 1. Technical/Code Tasks (Inline)
For tasks directly related to specific lines of code, use comments in your source files.
**Format:** `// TODO(Category): Description`

**Examples:**
```javascript
// TODO(Auth): Add JWT token validation here
// TODO(UI): Fix alignment on mobile devices
2. Planning/Architectural Tasks (Files)
For larger tasks, user stories, or planning items that aren't tied to a specific line of code, create a Markdown file in the todo/ directory.

Location: todo/*.md or todo/**/*.md (subdirectories work too).

Naming: The filename is for your organization (e.g., task-001.md).

Title: The script uses the first H1 header inside the file as the task name in the master list.

Example File (todo/feat-login.md):

# Implement Login Page flow

- Design the UI
- Connect to API
How it Works
The system runs a script (scripts/generate-todo.js) that:

Scans src/ for // TODO comments.

Scans todo/ for .md files.

Merges them.

Generates a fresh TODO.md with links to the code and files.
